          Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands. Despite struggling with mental illness and poverty throughout his life, van Gogh produced over 2,100 artworks, including about 860 oil paintings, most of which were created in the last two years of his life. His works, characterized by bold colors and dramatic, expressive brushwork, include famous pieces like "Starry Night," "Sunflowers," and "The Bedroom." Van Gogh's style profoundly influenced 20th-century art. He died on July 29, 1890, in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, from a gunshot wound, believed to be self-inflicted. His legacy endures through his timeless masterpieces.
